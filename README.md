## About
Project Donetsk is an attempt to create a modder-friendly Modern Warfare 2019 with a server browser and GSC.

**The project is currently in beta. Bugs and issues are expected.**

## Features
- Custom content (maps, weapons, cosmetics).
- Server browser.

## Installation
- Visit our website for a download of the required game files.
- Download the latest DLL for Donetsk, or compile from source.
- Place the DLL into the game folder and launch `game_dx12_ship_replay.exe`.

**NOTE:** This does not work on the latest version of Modern Warfare (1.67). Attempting this on that version may risk a ban.

## Common Issues
- ```Failed to initialize TACT client: E_STORAGE_INIT (25), Invalid build info ```
  - Right click on game folder and uncheck "read-only"
- ```Fatal Error (Of any variety)```
  - Right click on game folder and uncheck "read-only"
- ```DirectX call failed with error: DX ERROR UNKNOWN[OX8000FFFF]. ```
  - This is a DirectX error. The best solution is to reinstall Windows from a recovery USB, but you may have some sucess in simply repairing your Windows installation
